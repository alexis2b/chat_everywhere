Frequently asked questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	This FAQ should answer most of the questions that you may have about using
Chat Everywhere. If it does not, send me a mail with your question at
alexis@bernis.org.


1. Where can I find the latest version of Chat Everywhere ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  As of now, the project is hosted by sourceforge. You can check the latest news
and download the latest releases at http://chateverywhere.sourceforge.net .


2. What do I need to run it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The server should compile fine on most Unix-like systems. I try to build
it regularly on Linux, Solaris, Free-BSD, and sometimes on MacOS X. Apart from
that, it is all standard POSIX C, so no special libraries are required.

  The client is written in Java, and will work with most of the java enabled
browsers (check the COMPATIBILITY file in the client documentation).


3. Server ? Client ? What's that stuff means ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Chat Everywhere is actually two components : a server and a java applet
(referred as the client). The server runs on its own, and receives the
requests from the clients.

  As of now, the only client available is a Java applet, so the user needs not
install anything. Each time it will go on the chat web page, its browser will
download and run the applet, thus acting as a client (it runs on the user
computer, and not on the server).


4. Can I use IRC commands ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The server can recognizes some special commands. Some are from Irc, some are
unique to Chat Everywhere. A command starts by a slash / . You can have a list
of the recognized commands by typing /help in the client. You can have a
detailed help about a command by typing /help my_command.

  For example /help op will give you some more help on the op command.
  
  Note that you may be denied the use of some commands under a given level.


5. What are those levels ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can think of it as a rank. 0 is the lowest and 9 is the highest (operator).
You can only take certain actions on people who have a rank lower than yours.
For example, if you are level 2, you can kick (deconnect of the chat) the users
at level 0 or 1, but not 2 or higher.

  There are two ways to increase its level: using the /op command with the
operator password, thus gaining level 9, or having somebody higher than you
using the /setlevel command to increase your rank.

  The administrator can also use the AutoLevel directive in the configuration
file to give automatically a given rank to somebody based on its nick and/or
its IP address.


5. Do I need admin level (=root) to install and run chat_server ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  No, there is no need to have root privileges to install or run
chat_server. But the default configuration expects to write in
system-wide places, so you need to change the installation directory.

For that, use the --prefix flag of the configure script.

Example :

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/foobar/chat
$ make
$ make install

will install all the chat_server files in /home/foobar/chat
