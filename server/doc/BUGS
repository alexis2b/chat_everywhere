How to report a bug ?
=====================


	If you encounter a bug, or if you want to make a suggestion, please
send a mail to <alexis@bernis.org> containing the following informations :

	- how the problem occurred (steps you have followed, any special command,
	etc...)
	- chat_server version you use (chat_server --version)
	- your system (ex : Slackware Linux 2.0.36 with libc5) with
	operating system, browser and java virtual machine (if the problem
	ocurred while using the java client)
	- the chat.log file
	- your chat.conf file (remove the password field if you don't want me
	to see it)
	- a gdb trace (or a strace) in the case of a SIGSEGV


	You may also use the bug tracker on the SourceForge project page, head
your browser to : http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chateverywhere and
select Bugs (like that you are kept informed of the bug fix).

	Thank you for reporting such a bug, I will answer your mail and provide
an eventual patch as soon as I can.
