  Chat Server give you the possibility to easily put a real-time discussion
forum on your website. It allows extended (Irc-like) commands, several levels
of hierarchy and an easy to modify configuration file.
  The goal of this project is to provide webmasters with a simple to use, but
very configurable, chat zone on their site. The requirements on the client
side are as low as a java enabled browser (most of them are). The server is
very light (coded in standard, portable C), and can run on very small servers.
It does not require admin (root) rights.

	It features :

	o= various channel-management functions (kick, ban, etc...)
	o= hierarchy levels (from 0 to 9)
	o= secure password protection
	o= simple config file (a la Apache)
	o= extended logging
	o= easy integrated java applet with a configurable look
	o= support for remote server (signed applet)
	o= and... it's free and under GPL.

	Please refer to INSTALL for more detailed instructions about
how to install chat server on your system and BUGS if you encounter
any problem with this program.
