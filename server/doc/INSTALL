Special notes about chat_server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  These are the steps required to install chat_server on your system. No
special libs are required but includes may vary from one Unix to another.

  You need admin rights to install chat_server in its default location
(binary in /usr/local/sbin, config file in /usr/local/etc and man page in
/usr/local/man). But you may use the --prefix option of the configure script
to install it to another location. No special rights are required to run
chat_server (unless you specify a port number < 1024).

  The following platforms are officially supported :

    o= Linux
    o= FreeBSD
    o= Solaris
	o= HP-UX
	o= MacOS X (Darwin)

  Please tell me about any platform specifics bugs so as to extend this list
(see the BUGS file).


Step-by-step installation guide :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1). Check src/server_config.h for default values you would like to change,

2). Run the configure script :
      ./configure
    This will try to detect your configuration automagically.
    Note : you can use --disable-i18n to disable the use of gettext which
    allows translated messages from the server.

3). When it is done, build chat_server with
      make
    If you see any compilation error at this point, report them with all the
    output of the compiler (see the BUGS file).

4). Once the compilation is over, you may install the package (you may need root
    if you want to install it in a generic location) :
      make install
    This will copy the package files in various locations (note : you can
    modify this with the --prefix option in step 2).
	If you don't want that, you can copy manually the chat_server file from
	the sbin/ directory into a convenient one (take also the sample chat.conf
	and chat.motd files).

5). Edit the sample chat.conf file (by default in /usr/local/etc) to fit
    your needs. You may also edit the sample chat.motd (Mot Of The Day).

6). Install the java client in your web tree (detailed instructions are given
    in the INSTALL file of the client).

7). You may now launch the server. Use the given man page (man chat_everywhere)
    to figure out all the availables command line options (especially the
    --config-file one, depending on where you have put your chat.conf file).
    ex : /usr/local/sbin/chat_server --config-file=/etc/chat.conf --background

8). Run your favorite java-enabled web browser, point it toward the location
    of your web page.

9). enjoy.

Note : you may want to make it run automatically at each boot. Depending
on your system, you may have to add a line in your startup scripts (/etc/rc.d
in the BSDish style) or make a simple SysV script (for RedHat based distribs)
(one should be included soon).
