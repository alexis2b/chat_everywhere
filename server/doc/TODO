TODO

	- administrative interface, to see the server current config
	and allow to restart / change the config from anywhere

	- Add escape sequences for user statistics
	
	- generic help (as text files) invoked by the /help command

	- enhance the password protection for nicks
	/pass oldpass newpass to change the password

	- flood protection (5 lines in 3 seconds for a nick)

	- server linking

	- put a ban's reason to ban command, and display it
	when refusing login

	- rethink a binary "all-in-one" distribution

	- MySQL backend (cleanly done : should be activated in the
	configure style).
	
	- CMS integration : lile AWF, PhpNuke, ... The MySQL backend
	would help a lot.

	- storage to prevent loss of infos in case of crash
		- store ban / gag infos
		- store statistics

	- moderated channels : would set a minimum level to be allowed to
	talk. Example : /moderate 5 -> you need at least level 5 to be allowed
	to talk

	- invisible administrator (???)
	
	- add client parameters to give options default value and an option
	to disable the Options button.

	- check that connection is closed cleanly in every cases (seems that
	we have some stale sockets).
