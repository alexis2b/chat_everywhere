Here you can find examples of some methods of passing parameters to
the chat client applet. If you find any ommissions/mistakes/etc. in
them please let me know (pxxs@staszic.waw.pl).

chat.cgi

    This is a simple CGI script running in Bourne-compatible shell,
    thus it should work on every UNIX platform. You can pass a
    nick= parameter to it via GET method. If you won't, a form
    allowing you to enter the nick will be shown.

chat.html

    This is a client-side method written in JavaScript. When you click
    the button, the script will read the nickname you entered, truncate
    the page and write HTML code that will run the chat client applet.

chat.php

    Basically, it does the same job as chat.cgi, but it's written
    in PHP4. It also remembers your nick using cookies. If you pass
    a nick= parameter via GET, the cookie setting will be overriden.
