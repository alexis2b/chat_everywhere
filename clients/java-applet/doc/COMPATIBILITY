JVM : Java Virtual Machine, the software that runs the applet inside
your browser.

* some users have reported problems connecting to the applet with
  Mozilla1.0, but I have successfully tested that. If that happens to you,
  please send me a *full* bug report with mozilla version, OS, java used,
  Thanks !

** the MS JVM does not provide a full compatibility with the standard
  Java API, and some functionnalities may not work correctly. This is
  the case of some options.


Notes:
~~~~~~

	- the sun Java plugin can be downloaded for free at
	http://java.sun.com/getjava

	- unsigned applet does not support the connexion to a server different
	from the one who served the web page (use of ServerHost parameter)



If you have (un)successfully tested the Java client on other platforms,
please let me know at <alexis@bernis.org>, thanks !
