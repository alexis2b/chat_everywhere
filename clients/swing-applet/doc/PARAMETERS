Applet parameters (both for Java and Swing applets if not specified).

server.name  (was ServerHost)
server.port  (was ServerPort)
	Host name (or IP address) and port number of the server to connect to.
	This parameter is *optional*, if not specified, the applet will attempt
	to connect to the web server.
	IMPORTANT : due to Java security restrictions, you need a signed applet
	if you want to connect to a server different from the web server !

auto.nick  (old syntax : Nick  also accepted)
	This parameter, if present, makes the chat client connects
	automatically to the server with the given nick, without asking
	the user. This is especially useful with dynamically generated
	web pages where the user is already authenticated in some kind
	of way. You can generate the auto.nick parameter to have the same
	name on the web site and on the chat.
	Look at the contrib/ directory for some examples of dynamically
	generated logins.

auto.startchatwith  (was StartChatWith)
	If present, you are automatically starting with a private message
	window for the user nick you specify.
	This allows you, on a website, to put a list of all the available
	users, and, when somebody click on a name, launch a chat session with
	messages directed to this specific person.

locale.language  (old syntax : Language  also accepted)
locale.country   (old syntax : Country   also accepted)
	These two parameters are used to set a website-defined locale.
	I.E : you know that your users speak french, so you can force a
	french locale.
	The locale will impact the way characters are drawn (accents for
	French, cyrillic, ...) and the messages users will get (translated
	in their own language).
	If not specified, the default user locale will be used, which is
	often a good choice.

	IMPORTANT : you need to specify *both* parameters for this to
	work.


form.*	The applet zone itself (general settings)

form.backgroundcolor (or BgColor)
form.text.color      (or FgColor)
	These settings allow you to set the colors of all the applet's elements
	at once. These are the "default" settings for background and foreground
	colors. You can use some more precise parameters later to change individual
	components of the user interface (login area, user list, text zone...).
	You need to specify a triplet of hexadecimal values (red, green and blue)
	started by a "#".
	Example :
	#ff0000	bright red


form.text.font	(or UIFontName)
	This setting will specify the font used to render the user interface
	(not the text you type) such as menus and labels.
	If not specified, the "Arial" font is used.

	The login form displayed before entering the chat.
	
login.backgroundcolor  (was LoginFgColor)
login.text.color       (was LoginBgColor)
	Background and foreground colors of the login form.

	Specifies the font used to render the text typed and displayed on the chat.
	Default value is "Courier"



chat.userlist.backgroundcolor  (was UsersBgColor)
chat.userlist.text.color       (was UsersFgColor)
	Background and Foreground color of the user list.

chat.input.backgroundcolor     (was InputBgColor)
chat.input.text.color          (was InputFgColor)

	your messages).
