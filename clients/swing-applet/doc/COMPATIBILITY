JVM : Java Virtual Machine, the software that runs the applet inside
your browser.

	This client makes use of the Swing library which is only supported
right now by the Sun Java plugin. This plugin runs on Solaris, Windows,
Linux and some other Unices (like BSD). It is supported in all the major
web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla, or Netscape Navigator.

	You can download and install the plugin for free at the following
location : http://java.sun.com/getjava

	This applet is always tested with the latest version of the Java
plugin (1.4.2_06 as of now) but should be compatible with any of its release.


Notes:
~~~~~~

	- unsigned applet does not support the connexion to a server different
	from the one who served the web page (use of ServerHost parameter)


If you have (un)successfully tested the Java client on other platforms,
please let me know at <alexis@bernis.org>, thanks !
